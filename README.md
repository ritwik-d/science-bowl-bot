# Sci Bowl Bot

Hi everyone!

Sci Bowl Bot is a Discord bot designed to grow the Science Bowl community with a system of asking/answering questions in a fun way!

[National Science Bowl homepage](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/nsb/About)

I made this with the help of my friend, Anand Srinivasan, when we noticed fallacies in other softwares that tried to optimize Science Bowl for online circumstances

We then developed this platform, which has now amassed 50+ users across the globe, and has asked over 25,000 questions.

Our goal is to continue to allow Sci Bowl Bot to revolutionize Science Bowl online.


Thanks,
The Sci Bowl Bot Team
